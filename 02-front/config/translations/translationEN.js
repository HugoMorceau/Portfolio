  Aboutme: `Hello, my name is Hugo, a passionate French developer with 10 years of experience in Ad√©lia, RPG4, and COBOL languages on AS/400 systems.
  \nIn 2022, I decided to explore new horizons by diving into the fascinating world of web development and thus pivot my professional focus. To achieve this, I completed an intensive 6-month course with O'Clock School in a remote format. This experience allowed me to gain skills in modern programming languages.
  \nThis transition also coincided with my move from Paris to the wonderful city of Barcelona, where I have chosen to settle and embark on both a professional and personal adventure.
  \nDriven by curiosity and passion, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to ambitious and innovative projects with enthusiasm.
  \nCurrently seeking professional opportunities, please feel free to download my CV and contact me to discuss potential collaborations.`,
